               isoforms than other methods. This article describes the RNA-Seq

               advances made so far in characterizing several eukaryote
               transcriptomes.",

  abstract  = "The long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) Xist is a master regulator of
               X-chromosome inactivation in mammalian cells. Models for how Xist
               and other lncRNAs function depend on thermodynamically stable
               secondary and higher-order structures that RNAs can form in the
               context of a cell. Probing accessible RNA bases can provide data
               to build models of RNA conformation that provide insight into RNA
               function, molecular evolution, and modularity. To study the
               structure of Xist in cells, we built upon recent advances in RNA
               secondary structure mapping and modeling to develop Targeted
               Structure-Seq, which combines chemical probing of RNA structure
               in cells with target-specific massively parallel sequencing. By
               enriching for signals from the RNA of interest, Targeted
               Structure-Seq achieves high coverage of the target RNA with
               relatively few sequencing reads, thus providing a targeted and
               scalable approach to analyze RNA conformation in cells. We use
               this approach to probe the full-length Xist lncRNA to develop new
               models for functional elements within Xist, including the repeat
               A element in the 5'-end of Xist. This analysis also identified
               new structural elements in Xist that are evolutionarily
               conserved, including a new element proximal to the C repeats that
               is important for Xist function.",
