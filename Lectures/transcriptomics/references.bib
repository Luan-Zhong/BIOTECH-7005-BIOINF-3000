               X-chromosome inactivation in mammalian cells. Models for how Xist
               and other lncRNAs function depend on thermodynamically stable
               secondary and higher-order structures that RNAs can form in the
               context of a cell. Probing accessible RNA bases can provide data
               to build models of RNA conformation that provide insight into RNA
               function, molecular evolution, and modularity. To study the
               structure of Xist in cells, we built upon recent advances in RNA
               secondary structure mapping and modeling to develop Targeted
               Structure-Seq, which combines chemical probing of RNA structure
               in cells with target-specific massively parallel sequencing. By
               enriching for signals from the RNA of interest, Targeted
               Structure-Seq achieves high coverage of the target RNA with
               relatively few sequencing reads, thus providing a targeted and
               scalable approach to analyze RNA conformation in cells. We use
               this approach to probe the full-length Xist lncRNA to develop new
               models for functional elements within Xist, including the repeat
               A element in the 5'-end of Xist. This analysis also identified
               new structural elements in Xist that are evolutionarily
               conserved, including a new element proximal to the C repeats that
               is important for Xist function.",

 abstract = {Automated partial DNA sequencing was conducted on more than 600 randomly selected human brain complementary DNA (cDNA) clones to generate expressed sequence tags (ESTs). ESTs have applications in the discovery of new human genes, mapping of the human genome, and identification of coding regions in genomic sequences. Of the sequences generated, 337 represent new genes, including 48 with significant similarity to genes from other organisms, such as a yeast RNA polymerase II subunit; Drosophila kinesin, Notch, and Enhancer of split; and a murine tyrosine kinase receptor. Forty-six ESTs were mapped to chromosomes after amplification by the polymerase chain reaction. This fast approach to cDNA characterization will facilitate the tagging of most human genes in a few years at a fraction of the cost of complete genomic sequencing, provide new genetic markers, and serve as a resource in diverse biological research fields.},

    abstract = {The Functional ANnoTation Of the Mammalian genome (FANTOM) Consortium has continued to provide extensive resources in the pursuit of understanding the transcriptome, and transcriptional regulation, of mammalian genomes for the last 20 years. To share these resources with the research community, the FANTOM web-interfaces and databases are being regularly updated, enhanced and expanded with new data types. In recent years, the FANTOM Consortium's efforts have been mainly focused on creating new non-coding RNA datasets and resources. The existing FANTOM5 human and mouse miRNA atlas was supplemented with rat, dog, and chicken datasets. The sixth (latest) edition of the FANTOM project was launched to assess the function of human long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). From its creation until 2020, FANTOM6 has contributed to the research community a large dataset generated from the knock-down of 285 lncRNAs in human dermal fibroblasts; this is followed with extensive expression profiling and cellular phenotyping. Other updates to the FANTOM resource includes the reprocessing of the miRNA and promoter atlases of human, mouse and chicken with the latest reference genome assemblies. To facilitate the use and accessibility of all above resources we further enhanced FANTOM data viewers and web interfaces. The updated FANTOM web resource is publicly available at https://fantom.gsc.riken.jp/.},
