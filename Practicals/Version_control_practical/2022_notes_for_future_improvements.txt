Notes after giving lecture/tute/prac in 2022 - on what to change next time:

LECTURES:

* Git internals  - it is a useful mental model to think about changes and diffs. Other version control systems like SVN, Mercurial, Perforce etc store deltas (changes/diffs). But to be super-fast (at the expense of using more disk) Git stores references to complete blobs. Each commit object contains a hash of the tree, which recursively and completely defines the content of the source tree at that commit. There's a nice explanation in the git community book of what goes into blob objects, tree objects and commit objects .

https://book.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects

So - might want to make clear that internally Git is not a "diffs only" even though that's a good mental model to have.

Cyan Monkey and Blue monkey are not visually distinct enough - perhaps re-generate as red/yellow/purple etc - the prompt in Dall-E 2 was:

"a monkey hacker sitting at a desk looking at many screens full of code"

TUTORIAL

* There's quite a bit of overlap between the git in the tute and the prac, I would ideally merge them all into the prac, and then add more background information into the 

A lof of the "bonus material" at the end of the prac could be moved into the tute. 

So for instance - add more on branching / merging - perhaps go over this more, with visual diagrams of the branches

Go into workflows and working with others etc - https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow

(the trouble is, to do real multi-person work, you need to have signed up to Github etc - perhaps we should just do this so that the tute is more collaborative?)

PRACTICAL

The red/yellow/green "traffic lights" post-it notes on the monitor worked well

I think this was good, though we ran out of time as we had to re-do stuff as many people didn't do the tute. Having a bigger class where everyone sync'd up at checkpoints meant it went slower than it could have.

Nobody got to the "bonus material" in the prac - so should move that all into the tute really.

The pipeline.sh script sometimes blocked if people ran it multiple times I think due to /dev/urandom running out of entropy - should change that
