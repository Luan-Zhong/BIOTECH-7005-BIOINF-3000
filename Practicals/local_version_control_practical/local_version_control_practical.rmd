## Git help

Like most command line programs, git has command line help. Run:

```
git --help
```

This shows an overview of sub commands. It's short, read it all!

```
start a working area (see also: git help tutorial)
   clone     Clone a repository into a new directory
   init      Create an empty Git repository or reinitialize an existing one

work on the current change (see also: git help everyday)
   add       Add file contents to the index
   mv        Move or rename a file, a directory, or a symlink
   restore   Restore working tree files
   rm        Remove files from the working tree and from the index

examine the history and state (see also: git help revisions)
   bisect    Use binary search to find the commit that introduced a bug
   diff      Show changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc
   grep      Print lines matching a pattern
   log       Show commit logs
   show      Show various types of objects
   status    Show the working tree status

grow, mark and tweak your common history
   branch    List, create, or delete branches
   commit    Record changes to the repository
   merge     Join two or more development histories together
   rebase    Reapply commits on top of another base tip
   reset     Reset current HEAD to the specified state
   switch    Switch branches
   tag       Create, list, delete or verify a tag object signed with GPG

collaborate (see also: git help workflows)
   fetch     Download objects and refs from another repository
   pull      Fetch from and integrate with another repository or a local branch
   push      Update remote refs along with associated objects
```

You can get help for a subcommand via:

```git clone --help```

This opens a man (manual) page, and is the equivalent of ```man git-clone```

Scroll through the man page with up/down keys, then page up/page down keys.

Press q to quit the man page.

## Git setup / config

Git tracks which user did what, so you need to identify yourself.

If you didn't do this in the tutorial, please run this:

```
git config --global user.name "Your name"
git config --global user.email "your.name@student.adelaide.edu.au"
git config --global core.editor "nano -w"
```

This is stored in your home directory and so works on all git repositories (global)

To see it:

```
cat ~/.gitconfig
```

## Local repository

If you have already done this in a previous tutorial, you need to update it:

```
cd BIOTECH-7005-BIOINF-3000 # Wherever you cloned it before
git pull  # fetch changes from GitHub and update your local repository 
# If you get errors due to changes from the last tutorial, perhaps it is easier to just delete it and clone it again.
```

If you haven't cloned the repo before, do so via:

```
# Clone a repo
git clone https://github.com/University-of-Adelaide-Bx-Masters/BIOTECH-7005-BIOINF-3000
```

When you clone a repo - you make a local copy of the whole version control database (history, deleted files etc)

## Changelog / History

A git repository is a sequence of changes, you can see a history of these via:

```
git log
```

This opens an interactive log (shows a ":" at the bottom) of commits in reverse chronological order (ie latest commits first). Press the up/down arrow keys to scroll, or page up and down. Press q to quit.

Notice that at the top of every commit is a hash - which is the unique label you can use to refer to that change.

There are lots of options, eg to show a summary of changes.

```
git log --stat --summary
```

Or to see a visual of branching/merging:

```
git log --graph
```

```

Or a more concise graph:

```
git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph
```

## Show / Diffs

To see the details of a particular commit, copy/paste a hash, eg:

```
git show 23d004b56503d2aaccc5f6e39993a8d10aee334c
```

To see the differences between two commits, you can use diff:

Show is the same as the difference between a commit and the previous commit:

```
git diff 11a25fea8e15523049896381de9312501053843d 23d004b56503d2aaccc5f6e39993a8d10aee334c
```

but you can eg look across 3 commits:

```
git diff 141d48db593f24783169062b1e94c4259bacfaeb f6cec9c27eea6ef854f754f1adbe3c3310cb708d
```

Exercise:

Use git log to find 2 commits, and run git diff between them.

Now add a few commits before/after it to see how the size of the diff grows

**Shortcuts**

HEAD is a shortcut to the latest commit. 

If you don't specify a second hash, it will default to HEAD, to show you all the changes since that commit.

Every commit usually has one "parent" commit which points to the previous state, some shortcuts:

```
# These also work on normal hashes not just HEAD
git show HEAD^  # to see the parent of HEAD
git show HEAD^^ # to see the grandparent of HEAD
git show HEAD~4 # to see the great-great grandparent of HEAD
```

```
# See last 2 commits:
git diff HEAD^^  # Implicitly comparin to HEAD
```

## Creating a new repository

```
# Go to where you want to put a new git repository
mkdir bioinfo_tute_wk8
git init
```

There is now a hidden directory called ".git"

 ```ls -R .git```

## Add/Commit

* Edit a file, eg "README.md"
* Paste in:

```
Apples
Watermelon
```

Then save the file, and exit to the shell. Run:

```
git status
```

This should show you that you have 1 untracked file called 'README.md'. 

To see this as a diff:

```
git diff
```

We need to tell Git about this change - run:

```
git add README.md
```

Now run:

```
git status
```

It should show you have a new file README.md, now run:

```
git commit
```

Because you didn't specify a messae, this will open up your editor (which we specified as nano earlier) to make one. Enter something like "initial shopping list" then exit. It will apply a commit with the message you entered.

## Staging area

Why did we have to do add and then commit? Ie why have a staging area instead of comitting directly?

![](https://openclipart.org/image/400px/332045)

It allows you to carefully add/remove individual files to build a commit - ie you can change a lot of files, then commit a few together, then others in a separate commit.

Think of it as a draft area where you can carefully build exactly what you want to commit.

## Second commmit

Edit README.md again, adding 2 more lines:

```
Bananas
Mango
```

Run

```
git commit
```

Again, it should say: "no changes added to commit" - because you haven't added the file. Let's do that and commit:

```
git add README.md 
git commit -m "add stuff"
```

We used the ```-m``` parameter to provide the commit message on the command line, so we didn't need to open up nano to type one.

Run:

```
git log
```

You can see your comments will stored against a commit for all time - make sure you spend a bit of time making them clear and useful!

Perhaps we should make that last message better, to edit it:

```
git commit --amend -m "Add Cyan monkeys's fruit"
```

## Git blame

You can also see which was the last commit to touch a line in a file - this git command is actually easy to remember!

```
git blame README.md
```

Now edit README.md again, and add a "* " to the front of each line so it looks like:

```
* Apples
* Bananas
* Mango
* Watermelon
```

Add/commit again:

```
git add README.md 
git commit -m "formatting - markdown bullet points"
```

Now run git blame again:

```
git blame README.md
```

You can see that since we touched every line in the file, git blame is all that commit, and not very useful. So you can ignore a particular commit:

```
git blame README.md --ignore-rev HEAD  # Or the commit hash of your formatting change
```

You can see why logically grouping changes in commits is useful, eg separating formatting changes vs adding new things.

I will often break up a change into multiple commits, eg "clean up the area - keep existing functionality the same but make it easier to extend/change" and then a separate commit of "add the new functionality". 

If you run an auto-linter / code formatting tool (and you should!), you can keep track of commits in a file and use ```--ignore-revs-file```

## Tagging

All commits have unique hashes as labels, however these don't mean anything and are hard to remember.

You can give commits your own names, which is called tagging.

```
git tag my_tag <hash from git log>  # need to change to your hash
```

A common use for tags is to label a release. This makes it easier to know the state of code in a release, find what releases are affected by bugs, and for instance show what changed between releases, eg:

[CDot change diff](https://github.com/SACGF/cdot/compare/v0.2.7...v0.2.8)

This is linked from the CHANGELOG file in one of my GitHub projects:

https://github.com/SACGF/cdot/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md

## Bash scripts + git

Tip from scientific reproducibility lecture. If you always use Git, you can keep track of what version of a script was run.

For instance, copy/paste this into a file pipeline.sh

```
#!/bin/bash

DATA_DIR=data
FASTA_FILE=${DATA_DIR}/dna.fasta
TODAY=$(date --iso)
GIT_COMMIT=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
RUN_LOG=pipeline_run_${TODAY}_${GIT_COMMIT}.log

mkdir -p ${DATA_DIR}

if [[ ! -e ${FASTA_FILE} ]]; then
    echo ">DNA sequence, ~25% accuracy" > ${FASTA_FILE}
    cat /dev/urandom | tr -dc 'GATC' | fold -w ${1:-50} | head -1 >> ${FASTA_FILE}
fi

echo "Script ${0} started $(date) in '$(pwd)'" > ${RUN_LOG}
echo "git: ${GIT_COMMIT}" >> ${RUN_LOG}
echo "Input: $(md5sum ${FASTA_FILE})" >> ${RUN_LOG}
```

Now add/commit it:

```
git add pipeline.sh 
git commit -m "reproducible pipeline"
```

And run it, then examine the logs:

```
bash pipeline.sh
cat *.log
```

This should have saved the output:

```
Script pipeline.sh started Fri 16 Sep 2022 01:16:32 ACST in '/home/dlawrence/localwork/bioinfo_tute_wk8'
git: 2af18ad1033bbd5efd90a0aa88acf59dc1d9c4c4
Input: 482b49fe8627a6a300b51f46f7e5c6ff  data/dna.fasta
```

**Exercise**

Modify this script to generate a longer DNA sequence with a different filename, then checking in the changes, then re-running it.

## Git ignore

Sometimes you deliberately don't want to track certain files.

Examples include binary files, logs, temporary files or editor configuration (so each person can set their own preferences)

Run 

```
git status
```

The log and data files are here. Let's say that in a real experiment they are enormous, and you don't want to check them in.

```
echo "data/" > .gitignore
echo "*.log" >> .gitignore
```

Now run:

```
git status
```

**Exercise**

Check in .gitignore

(optional) Write a 2000 word philosophy paper describing what you think should happen if you add .gitignore to the .gitignore file.

## Moving through history

Git stores (in .git) all of the changes ever applied to the files in the repo.

It is worth thinking of the "normal files" in the directory as temporary - "working files", they can be reconstructed at various historical points by replaying certain git changes. Re-applying all of the changes will create the "latest" versions, and you can selectively apply patches to move through historical versions.

![](https://openclipart.org/image/400px/332045)

Cat the first log file from your pipeline.sh runs above, and find the commit hash

To move the working files back to the state of this commit, you can run:

```
git checkout <commit_hash>  # Need to copy/paste from your git history
```

This will mention having a "detached head" - HEAD keeps track of the current point in a repository. Usually, it is attached to a branch (eg master), while moving through history, it's "detached"

You can also see this if you run 

```
git status
```

It will say "head detached"

**Exercise**

Run 

```
git log
``` 

and pick a commit, ie "initial commit"

Move the repo back to this commit, and examine the README.md file

To move back to the latest commit, run:

```
git checkout master
```

To check you're back to normal - run ```git log``` and ensure that the last commit has HEAD next to it


## Restoring deleted files

Delete the README.md, ie:

```
rm README.md
```

Now run:

```
git status  # Shows file was deleted
git diff  # Shows patch
```

Retrieve the file from the repo - to undelete it in the working files

```
git checkout README.md
```

## Branches

So far in your new repository we've been working in a linear way.

But remember Git is a graph, and you can have multiple paths (think back to the ```git log --graph``` diagrams above) that split apart.

The default branch is main/master, but you can diverge from this, and also merge together different branches.

A common task when working with multiple people is to create a branch from current HEAD to do new development, so you can store your code in the repository without breaking master.

You can create a branch then switch to it:

```
git branch blue_monkey # Creates a new branch from HEAD
git checkout blue_monkey
```

Or you could do this in 1 line via:

```
git checkout -b blue_monkey # if you run this after creating the branch above it will error and do nothing
```

Now edit the README.md and add a line "* Grapes"

```
git add README.md
git commit -m "blue monkey change"
```

Now, go back to the master branch.

```
git checkout master
cat README.md  # Double check that grapes are not there
git merge blue_monkey # Merge branch back into master
```

Because there were no conflicts - the merge was done automatically.

But imagine that the blue and cyan monkeys went off and did separate work. Find the commit before the merge, and create a branch from that, eg:


```
git checkout -b cyan_monkey HEAD^  # 1 commit back
```

Edit the README.md, say add "* Caffeinated bananas" and delete "* Watermelon"

Add/commit

```
git add README.md
git commit -m "cyan monkey shopping list changes"
```

Then back to main again:

```
git merge cyan_monkey
```

This can't be auto-merged and is flagged as a conflict.

```
Auto-merging README.md
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in README.md
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

If you look at the README.md it was merged, but with deliberate errors inserted around the merge conflict, so you have to manually edit it.

```
* Apples
* Bananas
<<<<<<< HEAD
* Grapes
=======
* Chocolate covered bananas
>>>>>>> cyan_monkey
* Mango
```

Edit this file, to put the entries in alphabetical order, then delete the lines with "<<<<" and ">>>" on them

```
git add README.md
git commit # editor will now suggest a 'merge' commit message
```

Now run:

```
git log --graph
```

Notice the branch and how it was merged back

**Exercise**

* Create a new branch (and switch to it)
* Create 2 modifications against that branch. Look at the log and pick 1 of the changes.
* Go back to master/main
* Run

```
git cherry-pick <the hash you want>
```

to only apply one change. This is useful to apply bug fixes to historical branches

## Pull / Push

When you clone a repository (eg from GitHub) you make a local copy (with all commits and history)

When you edit files and make make changes to this, you 

and also track where you got it from (remote origin) - so it is easy to keep them in sync.

**Fetch** - retrieves commits from another repo, but doesn't apply them
**Pull** - runs fetch, then applies the commits, in effect "syncing" your local repo to the remote
**Push** - send your changes to the remote server (we will cover this in either the bonus section below, and GitHub prac in Week 9)

## Bonus: Workflows

When working with others, you need to decide on how to use Git in your day to day work - these work patterns are often called [git workflows](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows)

For instance - is it ok to have broken code in master/main? If you are working by yourself, or are making very small changes you have tested well, it may be OK to commit directly into the main/master branch.

If you are running an open source project and random people download your code - maybe not!

If I am working on something larger than 1 day's work, I like to create a [feature branch](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow) so that I can push my code to Github (to have a backup + work on different computers) then merge back to master when done.

Some teams only do work in feature branches, then use pull requests to review the code by someone else before it is merged into master.

## Bonus: R studio git integration

Note: This may only work on the desktop version of R studio - haven't tested on web version.

Many [IDEs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) integrate with source control.

In R studio, select via top menu: 

* **file** -> **new project**
* Select **Existing project**
* Browse to the directory of the **BIOTECH-7005-BIOINF-3000** repository
* Click **Create Project**

There is now a git button in the toolbar (just below the top menu)


**Question** 

- Creating a new project caused a file "BIOTECH-7005-BIOINF-3000.Rproj" to appear in the repository. Why isn't this visible as an untracked file in the git panel?

## Bonus: GitHub

[Github](https://github.com) is a website that hosts git repositories on the internet, and also provides a number of services such as authentication, code browsing, issue tracking etc.

* Sign up for a GitHub account if you don't have one
* Login to the site

GitHub uses "Persoanl access tokens" rather than passwords. To generate one of these for the VM:

* Click on your user icon in the top right
* Click "Settings"
* In bottom left menu option - "Developer Settings", then "Personal Access token"
* Generate new token, label it something like "bioinformatics VM", it needs repository access

If you have password access to your VM, and you are happy to store your password in plain text on the VM, then you can do so via:

```
git config --global credential.helper store
```

Otherwise, just leave the tab open so you can copy/paste it, or copy/paste it into a temporary text editor

* Create a new repository (eg "bioinfo_tute_wk8")
* Follow the instructions labelled **...or push an existing repository from the command line**

When questioned for your password, paste in the personal access token (if you store credentials, it will save it now to your VM disk)

* Explore your repository on the GitHub site!

We will be going into GitHub in depth in the week 9 practical. Have a good mid-semester break!
